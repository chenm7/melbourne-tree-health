# Summary

In this paper, we seek to analyze the effects of tree age, size, location, placement, and other covariates on their useful life expectancy, a measure of health. Data is taken from official records kept by the City of Melbourne on its publicly-maintained trees. Though the original data includes information on the precinct for each tree, we instead use k-means clustering to divide the trees into clusters based on their geographical location. Using regression diagnostics, we find that using twelve clusters via the aforementioned method provides a better fit than using the original twelve precincts. Our final model indicates that tree size, location, placement, and age are important factors in determining useful life expectancy.

This project was done in collaboration with Douglas Turner.
